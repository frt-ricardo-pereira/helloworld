aboutDescription: "There are only 2 things you really need to join our course: to
                  speak English and have a will to learn. During 7 months our
                  mentors will teach you HTML, CSS and GIT, Javascript,
                  Databases and React. You’ll then have the chance to develop
                  your own project using everything you’ve learned in a Final
                  Project. The course was designed by our good friends at
                  HackYourFuture, who have been graduating programmers just like
                  you for years. If you want to know more about the course and
                  how to apply, let us know"
